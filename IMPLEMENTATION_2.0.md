# Implementation Plan 2.0: Michele Starace - Elite Industrial Evolution

This plan focuses on deep narrative, technical storytelling, and "Boutique" experience details that bridge the 1982 heritage with cutting-edge automotive engineering.

## 1. Narrative & Heritage Storytelling
- [ ] **"The 1982 Timeline" Section**: Implement a horizontally scrolling timeline showing key milestones from the family workshop's founding to its current Arval Premium Center status.
- [ ] **"Signature of Quality"**: Add a digital, animated "Michele Starace" signature in the footer as a personal seal of craftsmanship.
- [ ] **"Heritage to Future" Parallax**: A transition effect that bleeds a vintage workshop photo into a high-tech modern diagnostic photo on scroll.

## 2. High-End Interaction Models
- [ ] **Magnetic Navigation Links**: Apply a subtle "pull" effect to the header navigation links for a responsive, high-precision feel.
- [ ] **Background "Spotlight" Flash**: Add randomized, low-opacity light sweeps (spotlights) across the dark background to simulate a live workshop environment.
- [ ] **Scroll Progress "Top-Line"**: Implement an ultra-thin primary yellow scroll progress bar at the very top of the viewport.

## 3. Automotive-Specific Aesthetics
- [ ] **HUD/Dashboard UI Elements**: Design geometric "corner brackets" and thin HUD-inspired technical data lines around primary images and featured sections.
- [ ] **"Blueprint" Background Grid**: Add a faint, fixed-position technical grid (32px cells) in the background of the Services and Stats sections to emphasize "Meccatronica" engineering.
- [ ] **Animated Technical Labels**: Small, floating labels with thin lines (e.g., "DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM 4.0") that appear near high-tech workshop imagery.

## 4. Enhanced Media & Conversion Details
- [ ] **"Real-Time" Workshop Status**: Add a glowing "LIVE" indicator near the header/CTA showing if the workshop is currently open/taking bookings.
- [ ] **Multi-Step "Booking Wizard"**: Redesign the contact form into a sleek, 3-step high-speed wizard to reduce friction and feel more like a luxury concierge service.
- [ ] **Logo "Sweep" Glint**: Create a periodic CSS reflection sweep that travels across the Arval and Starace brand logos.

## 5. Mobile & Sensory Details (The "Luxury Car" Experience)
- [ ] **Haptic Feedback Mapping**: (Mobile-specific) Ensure major CTA interactions trigger subtle vibro-haptics for a weighted "physical" button feel.
- [ ] **Cinematic "Pan-Scroll" Images**: Implement a "Ken Burns" or parallax pan effect for all full-width photos so they "glide" slightly inside their containers during scroll.
- [ ] **Adaptive "Night Mode" Depth**: Introduce deep purple/navy shadows in the black backgrounds to give the site more dimensional "Night" atmosphere.
