# Service Card Redesign Plan

This artifact documents the transition from the previous bento-style, text-heavy service cards to a more compact, modern, and premium design tailored for an automotive workshop.

## Design Goals
- **Compactness**: Uniform card sizes for better grid scanability.
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Reduced text density focusing on key information.
- **Improved UX**: Clear CTA buttons and subtle interactivity (lift + shadow).
- **Direct Navigation**: seamless transition to detailed service pages.

## Card Components
- **Icon**: High-contrast icon in a styled container.
- **Title**: Bold, uppercase display font.
- **Description**: Truncated or shortened to 1-2 lines.
- **CTA**: "Scopri il servizio" button with a modern hover state.
- **Interaction**: Lift effect on hover with an enhanced drop shadow.
