# Implementation Plan: Michele Starace - Professional & Modern Evolution

## 1. Visual Polish & Premium Feeling
- [x] **Subtle Grain Texture Overlay**: Add a low-opacity (.03 - .05) noise/grain texture across the entire site for a cinematic, tactile feel.
- [x] **Glassmorphism & Depth**: Refine `backdrop-blur` on headers and add ultra-thin borders (`border-white/5`) to all cards and interactive elements.
- [x] **Bento Grid Layout (Services)**: Redesign the Services section from a uniform grid to an asymmetrical "Bento" layout with featured large cards.

## 2. Advanced Typography
- [x] **Text Masking (Hero)**: Apply a video or metallic texture mask to key header words (e.g., "SICURI").
- [x] **Background Parallax Display Text**: Add large, low-opacity "phantom" text (e.g., "PERFORMANCE") that scrolls at a different speed behind content.

## 3. High-End Animations
- [ ] **Smooth/Inertial Scrolling**: Implement Lenis or Locomotive Scroll for a premium "weighted" scroll experience.
- [ ] **Magnetic CTA Interactions**: Refine the button "pull" effect to be extremely subtle and high-precision.
- [ ] **Liquid/Reveal Transitions**: Create curtain or scale-up entry animations for major sections as they come into view.
- [ ] **Animated Counter Stats**: Add count-up animations for the Stats section values (40+, 50k+, etc.).

## 4. Enhanced Media & Trust
- [ ] **Video Backgrounds (Hero)**: Replace static hero background with a slow-motion, high-definition cinematic car/workshop loop.
- [ ] **Interactive Brand Wall**: Add hover color/glint effects to partner logos (Arval, Petronas, etc.).

## 5. UX & Branding Details
- [x] **Custom Themed Scrollbar**: Design a slim dark-grey scrollbar with a primary yellow thumb.
- [ ] **Adaptive Theme Cursor**: Make the custom cursor change shape/function contextually based on hovered elements ("View", "Close", etc.).
- [ ] **Service Card "Glow" Effect**: Implement a radial glow that follows the cursor inside the service cards.
